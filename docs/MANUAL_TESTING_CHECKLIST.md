# 🧪 **Manual Testing Checklist - Quick Verification**

## 🚀 **Start Here**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open: `http://localhost:3000`

## ⚡ **Key Performance Tests (5 minutes)**

### **1. Test Business Owner Query Performance**
1. Go to `/dashboard/products` (as business owner)

4. **Expected**: Response time < 500ms, only fetches your products

### **2. Test Caching Behavior**
1. Go to `/dashboard/products`
2. **First load**: Note the time in Network tab
3. **Refresh the page** (F5)
4. **Second load**: Should be noticeably faster
5. **Expected**: 20-50% improvement on second request

### **3. Test Search Performance**
1. Go to `/dashboard/products`
2. Type in search box: "test"
3. **Expected**: Debounced search (waits 500ms before searching)
4. **Check**: No excessive API calls while typing

## 🔧 **Functionality Tests (10 minutes)**

5. **Expected**: All work smoothly

### **7. Error Handling**
1. Try to create product with empty name
2. **Expected**: Clear validation error message
3. Try to edit product you don't own (if possible)
4. **Expected**: Proper authorization error
